# ForFileDelete
This program made in Java basically deletes all the file with a given extension in a given file folder.

# How to use
You just input the extension name (without the period, e.g. "txt", not ".txt") and then click the "Submit" button.
# Versions
Version 1 is using the java.awt interface, which is used in Windows XP, therefore looking basic and not beautiful.
