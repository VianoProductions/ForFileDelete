# ForFileDelete
This program made in Java basically deletes all the file with a given extension in a given file folder.

# How to use
You simply input the extension name (without the period, e.g. "txt", not ".txt") in the field and then click the "Submit" button. You will be prompted on the newest version to confirm you want to delete the files.

# Versions
Version 1 is using the java.awt interface, which is used in Windows XP, therefore looking basic and not beautiful.

Version 2 is using the JavaFX DirectoryChooser, which is used in Windows 7 and late versions of Windows. Highly recommended to use this one.

# Disclaimer
This executable will be detected by Windows as dangerous, although it's completely safe. This program deletes files, so I do not take responsability for lost/unsaved files.
